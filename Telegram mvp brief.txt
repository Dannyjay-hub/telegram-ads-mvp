Telegram MVP Contest

🏆 Reward: $15,000+ $BUILD grant to make the product prod-ready

Goal
Build an MVP Telegram Mini App for an ads marketplace that connects channel owners and advertisers, using an escrow-style deal flow.

MVP Scope
1) Marketplace model (both sides must be supported)

Channel owner listings:
Channel owner lists their channel, sets pricing, and adds a bot as an admin (for stats verification and future auto-posting).

Extra: think about PR manager flow and ability to add 1+ users to manage channel, for example fetch admins of the channel with selected rights. You must re-check if user still an admin on financial and other important operations.

Advertiser requests:
Advertiser creates a request/campaign brief; channel owners (influencers) can apply.

Both entry points must converge into a single unified workflow for negotiation, approvals, escrow, and auto-posting. For messaging, use a text bot; don't create a chat in a mini-app.

Implement practical filters for both offer types(pricing, subscribers, views, etc.)

2) Verified channel stats (from Telegram)
Automatically fetch and display verified channel stats available via Telegram, including (at minimum):
— subscribers
— average views / reach
— language charts
— Telegram Premium stats
— any other metrics exposed by Telegram channel analytics

3) Ad formats and pricing
Support setting prices for different ad formats within a single channel, eg.: post, forward/repost, story, and other formats you deem suitable, but only post is OK for MVP. This should be a free format rather than a strict ad type.

4) Escrow deal flow
Implement an escrow-style flow:
payment by advertiser → funds held by us → auto-posting confirms delivery → release or refund
This should be secure; it is recommended to use a new address/wallet for each deal or for each user, except for a hot wallet.
Include basic lifecycle controls such as:
— auto-cancel / timeout if the deal stalls (no activity for X time)
— clear deal statuses and transitions

5) Creative approval workflow
A clear approval loop must exist:
advertiser submits preferences / brief → channel owner accepts or rejects → if accepted, channel owner drafts the post and submits it for review → advertiser approves or requests edits → once approved, the post is auto-published at the agreed time

6) Auto-posting
Auto-post the approved creative to the channel and verify it's not deleted, edited, etc. — verify that creative is done and stay in channel for enough time before releasing funds to channel owner.

Stack
We do not restrict the tech stack. We want to see your product thinking, engineering decisions, and system design. Your code should be clean and ready to opensource.
Backend is the main focus. If you’re short on frontend capacity, a lightweight UI is acceptable, prioritize working flows over visual polish, it can be vibecoded, for reference use other tools on tools.tg

Submission
GitHub repo + README (run/deploy instructions)
